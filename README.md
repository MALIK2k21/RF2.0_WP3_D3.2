# RF2.0 D3.2 MATLAB CODE



## Getting started

The main files are objective_fucntion.m and optimization_function.m. The former file simulates the whole system and output Total net present cost and Carbon Footprint of whole system. The optimization_function lets you conduct a multi-objective GA based optimization.
For starter, run optimization_function.m;however, keep in mind that all the files must be in same directory otherwise an would occur.

## Note

The replication of results presented in the associated Report D3.2 would be difficult because:

- The stochastic nature of genetic algorithm.
- The synthetic cost data of grid tariffs as actual tariffs can not be disclosed.
- The load demand curve is generted by randomnumbers as at the moment sharing the actual data is not feasible.
